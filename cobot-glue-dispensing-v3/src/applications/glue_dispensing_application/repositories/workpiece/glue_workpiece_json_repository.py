Description:
    This module handles the serialization and persistence of workpieces data in JSON format.
    Workpieces are stored in a structured directory format based on date and timestamp,
    enabling easy versioning and tracking of saved workpieces.

    It expects workpieces classes to inherit from JsonSerializable to enable proper
    (de)serialization.
