       Singleton class responsible for managing a single instance of the Workpiece repository.
       The class ensures that only one instance of the repository is created and provides a global
       point of access to it.

       This class uses `WorkpieceJsonRepository` to handle storage and retrieval of workpieces
       as JSON data.

       Attributes:
           _instance (WorkpieceJsonRepository or None): The single instance of the repository.

       Methods:
           get_instance(cls): Returns the singleton instance of the WorkpieceJsonRepository.

    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        """
                Retrieves the singleton instance of the `WorkpieceJsonRepository`. If the instance does
                not exist, it is created and initialized with necessary parameters.

                The repository is initialized with a directory path and a list of fields representing the
                attributes of a Workpiece. This ensures that the repository is set up to manage and store
                Workpiece objects correctly.

                Args:
                    cls (type): The class type, used to access the singleton instance.

                Returns:
                    WorkpieceJsonRepository: The singleton instance of the repository.

                Notes:
                    The instance is created with the directory `"system/storage"` and
                    a set of `WorkpieceField` attributes such as `WORKPIECE_ID`, `NAME`, `DESCRIPTION`,
                    and others required for managing Workpiece data.

                Example:
                    repo = WorkPieceRepositorySingleton.get_instance()
                    workpiece_data = repo.get_workpieces()  # Example of interacting with the repository
                """
